## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive Market Basket Analysis and Price Recommendation system for retail vendors. By leveraging historical sales data from multiple vendors, the system identifies optimal pricing strategies and provides insights into customer purchase behavior. The primary objective is to maximize profitability while maintaining competitive sales volumes.

## Features
Market Basket Analysis: Identify frequently bought together items using association rule mining.
Price Recommendation: Predict optimal prices for products based on customer purchase history and other influencing factors.
Cross-Vendor Analysis: Analyze data from multiple retail vendors to ensure robust and generalizable insights.
Dynamic Pricing: Adjust prices dynamically based on real-time sales data and market trends.
